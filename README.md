# -Covid-19-Face-mask-Detection
This Project goal to detect a in a webcam whether given human is wearing a mask or not. In this project we train the model with the help of CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks).Also for train the model and webcam detection we use library like OpenCV, keras and also use Tensorflow In backend.
